# PSEUDOCODE FOR MY PROJECT: Locating UCE cores and flanking regions
# 1. Download Phyluce:
# What Phyluce does – aligns assembled contigs back to their associated UCE loci, 
removes duplicate matches, creates a taxon-specific database of contig-to-UCE matches, 
and includes UCE loci from a known genome as outgroup sequences. (e.g. the chicken (Gallus gallus))

# Make sure Anaconda is in my $PATH 
# which python
# python -V (in terminal)

cd /usr/bin/
pwd
cd ~/
pwd
cd anaconda
ls
which python
python -V


# Add the Faircloth lab binstar repository to my .condarc:
# conda config --add channels http://conda.binstar.org/faircloth-lab

# Install Phyluce:
# conda install phyluce



# 2. Find UCE sequences: (not sure where this step fits in yet)
# Avian UCE contigs are available on Dryad (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sd080)
# UCE contigs used in analyses are also available from Genbank (accessions: JQ328245 - JQ335930, KC358654 - KC403881)
# Do I need to filter for anything? (software: Illumiprocessor, Sickle)
# I don't think so.. the contigs have already been filtered


#mkdir EEB234_UCE_project
cd EEB234_UCE_project

#curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faircloth-lab/uce-probe-sets/master/uce-2.5k-probe-set/uce-2.5k-probes.fasta > uce-2.5k-probes.fasta

ls


#3. Find where UCE probes are:
# McCormack et al. used amniote probes for birds
# LASTZ matches of amniote probes to avian species-specific contigs available on Dryad (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sd080)

#Matching contigs to probes

#General approach:
# make a directory for log files
# mkdir log
# match contigs to probes
# match_contigs_to_probes.py \
    --contigs /path/to/assembly/contigs/ \
    --probes uce-5k-probes.fasta \
    --output /path/to/uce/output \
    --log-path log

# On my terminal:

# mkdir log
# mkdir contigs
# mkdir output

# Match contigs to probes
match_contigs_to_probes.py \
    --contigs /Users/Vanessa/anaconda/EEB234_UCE_project/log/contigs \
    --probes uce-2.5k-probes.fasta \
    --output /Users/Vanessa/anaconda/EEB234_UCE_project/log/output \
    --log-path log

#I keep getting an error here – it’s saying the pathway for contigs is not a directory. I haven’t been able to fix this yet. Planning to meet with Princess next week.


# After I download UCE sequences, I will align probe sequences to these loci
# Then I will determine where the UCE cores vs. flanks are located

# If I have time after these steps, I will compare UCE alignments of cores and flanks across species
# Or I could start by just comparing alignments of cores and flanks between two species 
that are representative of adaptive / non-adaptive radiations (e.g. hummingbird/violetear and mousebird)
